Welcome to lwreg!
=================

lwreg is a lightweight registration system for chemical registration and data storage. 
The package provides a basic, yet flexible registration system that is useable from Python or the command line. lwreg can run completely locally, no server set up is required (though the system can use a PostgreSQL server if you have one available).
